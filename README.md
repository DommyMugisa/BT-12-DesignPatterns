## What is Design Pattern?

The design pattern is a technique which used by the developer to solve the commonly occurring software design. In simple word, it is a predefine pattern to solve a recurring problem in the code. These patterns are mainly designed based on requirements analysis.

The design pattern is a part of the software development. It is a general repeatable solution for the potential problem in software development. We can follow the patterns details and apply a solution which suits our code.

We may often confuse the patterns and algorithm, but both are separate approaches to solve repetitive problems. Algorithms generally define the clear set of the solution that can be implemented in some problems, where the patters are high-level description of the solution.
